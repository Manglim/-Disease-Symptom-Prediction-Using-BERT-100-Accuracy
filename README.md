🔬 Disease Symptom Prediction Using BERT | 100% Accuracy (Benchmark Dataset)

This project showcases a powerful disease prediction model built using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for text classification of symptoms into corresponding diseases. Leveraging a clean, structured dataset of symptom-disease mappings, the model achieves 100% accuracy on validation using optimized preprocessing, intelligent BERT tokenization, and fine-tuned hyperparameters.

🧠 Features:
✅ 100% Accuracy on benchmark dataset (symptom-to-disease classification)

🧹 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenizing, and encoding textual symptom descriptions

🤖 BERT Integration: Using Hugging Face Transformers for deep learning-based classification

📊 Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy reporting

📈 Training & Validation Logs included with visual insights

🚀 Tech Stack:
Python, PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face), Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Google Colab

🔍 Use Case:
Can be used as a base model for intelligent healthcare assistants, telemedicine apps, or symptom checker tools. This framework can be expanded to include multilingual support, more complex symptom clusters, and integration with EHR systems.
